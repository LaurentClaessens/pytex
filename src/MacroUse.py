    <macro_name> has to contain the initial \ of the macro. I you want to search for \MyMacro, ask for "\MyMacro"; not only "MyMacro"

    number_of_arguments is the number of arguments expected.
                Giving a too large number produces wrong results in the following example case where \MyMacro
                is supposed to have 3 arguments :
                \MyMacro{A}{B}{C}
                {\bf An other text}
                The {\bf ...} group is not a parameter of \MyMacro, while it will be fitted as a parameter.
            It None is given, we search first for the definition and then the expected number of arguments is deduced.

            Notice that the number_of_arguments is supposed to be the number of non optional arguments. We do not count the arguments
            within [] in the number.
    We do not fit the macros that are used in the comments.

    The use of give_configuration is explained in the documentation of LatexCode.search_use_of_macro

    macro_name is the name of the macro to be fitted like \MyMacro (including the backslash).

    /!\ We do not manage the case where the first argument is not immediately after the macro name, i.e.
            \MyMacro {argument} (with a space between \MyMacro and the first opening bracket)
        will be buggy.

    If fast is true, make more assumptions on the LaTeX code. Like no space, no \ and no {} inside or between the arguments.
